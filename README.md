# KPMG

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached KPMGâ€™s Lighthouse & Innovation Team.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

The client provided the team with 3 datasets(KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final.xlsx):

Customer Demographic
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months
I have done the preliminary data exploration, data cleaning, model development and data analysis to find out the decision factors for top customers.

Model developemnt: RFM Analysis

RFM stands for recency, frequency and monetary- RFM segmentation is a way to identify group of target customers to increase revenue.
The model shows customer engagement with the company in the three mentioned categories.
More details can be found in the presentation attached(Target_Customer-decision_approach).

I have used the best_customers_df.xlsx file in Tableau to explore hidden data trends. Here's what I found:

About 70% of the customers work in Manufacturing, Financial, Health industries.
Most of the best customers are young adults from the Mass customer wealth segment in addition to the middle-aged adults in all the wealth segments.
Sales(from the best_customers list) have been found only in the months of November and December, with 70% of the purchases in December.
Based on these findings, I have found a list of customers(new_target_customer_list.xlsx) to be targeted from the new list. The analysis shows, there is a high chance of gaining new customers and good profit if this list of customers is targetted.
